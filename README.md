## Tools:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Overview:

My goal for this project was creating a tool that both designers and developers can use for inspiration in creating websites. Using only CSS Grid and JavaScript to manipulate elements, this tool will randomly generate grid layouts. The user experience is designed to be as simple and accessible as possible, choose the amount of columns and generate as many times as you want.

## What I Learned:

- How to generate random values that can be inserted into CSS
- Designing a slider input that looks the same on all browsers
- A better understanding of JavaScript's classList.add, remove, and toggle, as well as setAttribute to change the style of CSS elements
